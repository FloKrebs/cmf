<h2>Getting started</h2>
<p>This tutorial has the goal to teach you to set up, run, calibrate and validate your own lumped hydrological model (and make a few nice figures for showing off). For calibration and validation <a href="http://fb09-pasig.umwelt.uni-giessen.de/spotpy/">SPOTPY</a> will be used. The SPOTPY code will only be explained in the detail needed for a simple calibration and validation. For additional information see <a href="http://fb09-pasig.umwelt.uni-giessen.de/spotpy/Tutorial/1-Introduction/">SPOTPY Tutorial</a>. It is useful but not necessary to have worked through the <a href="http://fb09-pasig.umwelt.uni-giessen.de/cmf/wiki/tutorial#Gettingstarted">basic CMF tutorials</a>. The lumped model covered in this tutorial is relatively complex. It might seem a bit overwhelming at first, but this way all the most common parts of CMF for lumped model building are covered. That way you will be able to build your own model after the tutorial more easily. Obviously you need to have <a href="http://fb09-pasig.umwelt.uni-giessen.de/spotpy/#installation">SPOTPY</a> and <a href="http://fb09-pasig.umwelt.uni-giessen.de/cmf/wiki/CmfInstall">CMF</a> installed on your computer to make this work. The model structure we are going to implement is shown <a href="http://s33.postimg.org/ioqfyrlfz/most_complex_fulda_v2_englisch.jpg">here</a>. To run the model we will also need data. For the tutorial semi randomly generated data can be downloaded here: <a href="http://fb09-pasig.umwelt.uni-giessen.de/spotpy/download/cmf_lumped/discharge.txt">discharge</a>, <a href="http://fb09-pasig.umwelt.uni-giessen.de/spotpy/download/cmf_lumped/max_min_avg_temp.txt">temperature</a> and <a href="http://fb09-pasig.umwelt.uni-giessen.de/spotpy/download/cmf_lumped/prec.txt">precipitation</a>.</p>
<h2>Introducing the template</h2>
<p>For the further steps we will use a template, that can be downloaded <a href="http://fb09-pasig.umwelt.uni-giessen.de/spotpy/download/cmf_lumped/tutorial_template.py">here</a>. With this template you can build your own model more easily. In this section you will get a rough introduction to the different parts of the template. Additionally you will need the <a href="http://fb09-pasig.umwelt.uni-giessen.de/spotpy/download/cmf_lumped/datawriter.py">datawriter function</a>.</p>
<p>''Defining model timespan, name and input data files'' </p><pre class="fragment">#!python
# Calibration time span
begin = 1980 # enter the starting year of the calibration here
# do not include the first year or so of your data to allow the model a

# the remaining years of your data set will be used for validation

prefix = 'mymodel'# enter model name here 

# Number of runs
runs = 10 # enter the number of runs here

fnT = 'max_min_avg_temp.txt' # enter the name of your max, min and average temperature here in °C
fnP = 'prec.txt' # enter the name of your precipitation data here in mm/day
</pre><p>Here we define the periods of the data that will be used for calibration and validation, give our model a name, define how often it will run and what the names of our input files are.</p>

<p>''Flexible parts setup:'' </p><pre class="fragment">#!python
def setparameters(self,name,   ):  # this list has to be identical with the one above
    """
    sets the parameters, all parameterized connections will be created anew in every run    
    """
    # enter changeable model connections and nodes here
</pre><p>In this part our flexible model structures will be defined, meaning the ones where the parameter values are changed each calibration run. Further explanations will be given in the 'Building the model' segment.</p>
<p>The following methods in the template loadPETQ and makestations are used to read in the weather files and to bring the data into a format that can be understood by CMF.</p>
<p>The next method in template is runmodel. We can also leave it as it is, with one line as an exception: </p><pre class="fragment">#!python
    solver = cmf.CVodeIntegrator(self.project,1e-8)
</pre><p>In this line we can define which numerical solver CMF will use and what its step will be. In this case we use the CVode integrator because it compensates for numerical problems in the snow routine which we will use later. If you don't need the snow routine in your models you can also use an simpler solver like Explicit Euler to speed things up. For further information on the numerical solvers in CMF look <a href="http://fb09-pasig.umwelt.uni-giessen.de/cmf/wiki/CmfTutSolver">here</a>, if you are unsure which one to use <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hyp.7899/full">this paper</a> might help you.</p>
<p>All other methods are for spotpy or visualisation and need not be changed during the tutorial.</p>
<h2>Adding the data</h2>
<p>The template accepts plain .txt files as input data in the same format as the files that can be downloaded above. To read them in the method loadPETQ is used. To do so you have to add the following lines to your init method: </p><pre class="fragment">#!python
        P,T,Tmin,Tmax,Q = self.loadPETQ()
        self.Q=Q
</pre><h2>Building the model</h2>
<p>'''Fixed parts'''</p>
<p>The first thing we have to do, is to indentify all our fixed model parts, meaning all parts that will be the same for every model run. In our case those are: - The CMF project as a whole - Our lumped cell for the whole catchment - The snow routine - The surface water storage - The soil storage - The two groundwater storages - The evapotranspiration - Our river - The drinking water outlet - The interception storage As you can see the fixed parts are all storages or storage like entities. Therefore, all flexible parts are the connections between all those storages. This is due to the structure of lumped models as the storages are mainly defined about the in- and outfluxes. To implement those fixed structures in CMF is relatively straightforward. The implementation of the fixed model structures takes place in the init method. The first thing we have to do is to make a CMF project, the structure which contains all model parts. </p><pre class="fragment">#!python
        self.project = cmf.project()
        p = self.project
</pre><p>All following structures refer to this project. The next thing we need to add is a cell. In CMF cells are the units of the <a href="http://fb09-pasig.umwelt.uni-giessen.de/cmf/wiki/CmfTutCell">horizontal discretization</a>. As we are making a lumped model, the cell doesn't need a certain position in space, so we can just set the coordinates x,y and z all to zero. Cells also need a size, but as we are constructing a lumped model, this also doesn't really apply. So we can just set our size to 1000, so our output will have the unit mm '''(Phillip nochmal fragen, ob ich das richtig verstanden habe)'''. </p><pre class="fragment">#!python
        c = p.NewCell(0,0,0,1000)
</pre><p>As the next structures we will add are the snow routine and the surface water storage. The snow routine is holding back water if the temperature is below a certain threshold temperature (snow melt rate). The surface water storage is needed for a more realistic routing. </p><pre class="fragment">#!python
        c.add_storage('Snow','S')
        cmf.Snowfall(c.snow,c)

        c.surfacewater_as_storage()
</pre><p>The soil and groundwater storages are added as layers to our cell. The argument defines the depth of the layer. After adding them we fill them with initial amounts of water, so our model has a quicker warm-up phase. As we have added a soil layer, we can also add the evapotranspiration from the soil. The evapotranspiration can be calculated in different ways in CMF (more information about CMF's handling of evapotranspiration can be found <a href="http://fb09-pasig.umwelt.uni-giessen.de/cmf/wiki/CmfTutET">here</a>). Here the <a href="http://www.zohrabsamani.com/research_material/files/Hargreaves-samani.pdf">Hargreaves</a> approach is choosen as it needs only little input data. If more data, e.g. wind velocity, is available more sophisticated approaches (like <a href="http://www.fao.org/docrep/x0490e/x0490e06.htm">Penman-Monteith</a>) can be used as well. </p><pre class="fragment">#!python
        soil = c.add_layer(2.0)
        gw_upper = c.add_layer(5.0) 
        gw_lower = c.add_layer(20.0)

        # Fill storages
        c.layers[0].volume = 100
        c.layers[1].volume = 200
        c.layers[2].volume = 300

        cmf.HargreaveET(soil,c.transpiration)
</pre><p>As a river is also a large storage for water it is added to this model. But as our model is a lumped one, we don't need coordinates. The area is referring to the surface of the river. This value must be calculated for every catchment seperately. Additionally you have to add a depth of the river, so CMF can calculate the volume of the river. </p><pre class="fragment">#!python
        self.river = p.NewOpenStorage(name="River",x=0,y=0,z=0, area = 100)
        # Giving the River a mean depth
        self.river.potential = 1.5 
</pre><p>The last thing we will add is an representation of a drinking water pump, the outlet to the catchment and an interception storage. </p><pre class="fragment">#!python
        # add the drinking water outlet
        self.drinking_water = p.NewOutlet('drinking_water',20,0,0)

        # Outlet
        self.outlet = p.NewOutlet('outlet',10,0,0)

        # Storage for the interception
        I=c.add_storage('Canopy','C')
</pre><p>Youre init method should now look something like <a href="http://www.file-upload.net/download-11542855/init_ohne_param.py.html">this</a></p>
<p>'''Flexible parts'''</p>
<p>As we now have added the fixed main structure of our model we have to connect them. This will be done in the method setparameters. To be able to work with the structures we have already implemented, we have to adopt them. This is done like the following: </p><pre class="fragment">#!python
        p = self.project
        c = p[0]
        outlet = self.outlet
        river = self.river
        drinking_water = self.drinking_water
</pre><p>The connection we will use the most is the <a href="http://fb09-pasig.umwelt.uni-giessen.de/cmf/chrome/site/doxygen/classcmf_1_1water_1_1kinematic__wave.html">kinematic wave</a>. This is because with the kinemativ wave many processes can be represented well enough for a lumped model. The syntax for the kinematic wave is: </p><pre class="fragment">#!python
        cmf.kinematic_wave(source, target, residence time, exponent, V0)
</pre><p>Where V0 represents '''???'''. To model the flux of a drinking water system a constant flux is needed. This is provide by the <a href="http://fb09-pasig.umwelt.uni-giessen.de/cmf/chrome/site/doxygen/classcmf_1_1water_1_1_technical_flux.html#a22a23463bd8a7a7d1fa2fe9ff87aef53">technical flux</a> in CMF: </p><pre class="fragment">#!python
        cmf.TechnicalFlux(source,target,max_flow,minmal_flow,cmf.day)
</pre><p>'''Was macht cmf.day?'''. The third connection we will use is the <a href="http://fb09-pasig.umwelt.uni-giessen.de/cmf/chrome/site/doxygen/classcmf_1_1water_1_1waterbalance__connection.html">waterbalance connection</a>. It is used to '''???''' and has the following syntax: </p><pre class="fragment">#!python
        cmf.waterbalance_connection(source, target)
</pre><p>Try to add those connections between the storages as you think it would best resemble our model structure. At the end of this segment a file will be provided how it should look like.</p>
<p>As it is sometimes neccesarry to make the snow melt temperature and the snow melt rate changeable parameters, we also implement it here and not in the fixed section. This is done like the following: </p><pre class="fragment">#!python
        snowmelt_surf = cmf.SimpleTindexSnowMelt(c.snow,target,cell,rate=meltrate)
        # set snowmelt temperature
        cmf.Weather.snow_threshold = snow_melt_temp
</pre><p>The last thing we will add is the interception to simulate water hold back by vegetation (more Information about Interception in CMF can be found <a href="http://fb09-pasig.umwelt.uni-giessen.de/cmf/wiki/CmfTutIntercept">here</a>: </p><pre class="fragment">#!python
        # Splits the rainfall in interzeption and throughfall
        cmf.Rainfall(c.canopy,c, False, True)
        cmf.Rainfall(c.surfacewater,c, True, False)
        # Makes a overflow for the interception storage
        cmf.RutterInterception(c.canopy,c.surfacewater,c)
        # Transpiration on the plants is added
        cmf.CanopyStorageEvaporation(c.canopy,c.evaporation,c)
        # Sets the parameters for the interception       
        c.vegetation.LAI= LAI
</pre><p>Your setparameters method should now look something like <a href="http://www.file-upload.net/download-11542922/setparameters_ohne_param.py.html">this</a>.</p>
<h2>Calibrating the model</h2>
<p>You now have a model almost ready for calibration. The last thing we have to do is to tell our model what the parameters are we want to calibrate and in what range we want them to be calibrated. For this we have to change two parts of our model we have created so far. The first one is the parameter list of the setparameter method. Here we have to fill in all parameters we have defined in the setparameters method. So for the example file for the setparameters method it should look like this: </p><pre class="fragment">#!python
    def setparameters(self,tr_soil,tr_surf,tr_GW_l, tr_GW_u, tr_fulda,
                      V0_soil,  
                      V0_surf,
                      beta_P, beta_surf_to_out, beta_surf_to_soil,
                      ETV1,
                      fETV0,
                      meltrate,
                      snow_melt_temp,
                      Qd_max,
                      LAI
                      ):
</pre><p>Here I have sorted the parameters to get an better overview, but you don't have to do that. To define the range of our calibration for the parameters we have to switch to the init method again. Here we have to assign the parameteres to our model class. To add your parameters there you have to give them a name and define a lower and upper boundary for them. For example: If I want to add two parameters with the names "residence_time" and "runoff_beta" with the values 1 to 12 respectiveley 0.1 to 2.0 the code would look something like this: </p><pre class="fragment">#!python
        self.params = [param('residence_time',1,12),('runoff_beta',0.1,2.0)]

I recommend to do the same in your own model so you don't get lost in them.</p>
<p>Now the model is ready to be calibrated. But before we start we have to make one decision. What kind of calibration algorithm do we want to use? <a href="http://fb09-pasig.umwelt.uni-giessen.de/spotpy/">Spotpy</a> includes a wide range of algorithms. For starters I would recommend [latin hypercube sampling](<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_hypercube_sampling">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_hypercube_sampling</a>) as it is method that produces good results quickly, but the theory behind it is still easy to understand. The template is pre configured to a simple Monte Carlo algorithm, so if we want to use latin hypercube sampling we have to change one line a bit. You can find the following line in the main method: </p><pre class="fragment">#!python
    from spotpy.algorithms import mc as Sampler
</pre><p>To use latin hpyercube sampling (or any other sampling provided by Spotpy you simple have to change the imported samper. For our example we have to change "mc" to "lhs". '''Tobi fragen ob er noch schlaue Sachen hier hinschreiben kann'''.</p>
<p>And now we can calibrate our model If you have done everything right the model should be complete now and you can simply start calibrating by running your code. If you didn't change the amount of runs, it should run the model ten times and then tell you what the best run was (this should require 1 or 2 minutes, depending on your hardware). If you did something wrong and can't figure it out our you simply didn't want to do all the steps above <a href="http://fb09-pasig.umwelt.uni-giessen.de/spotpy/download/cmf_lumped/tutorial_model.py">here</a> is a working piece of code for our example.</p>
<p>After you have run the model calibration CMF will have produced a few files. A simulation.csv and a parameters.csv. The parameter.csv contains all the parameter values of all runs together with the resulting value of the objective function (here the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency), while simulation.csv only contains those runs with a Nash-Sutcliffe higher than the threshold (the minimal value of the objective function the model should reach), together with the simulated discharge for all days. By viewing those files you can find out which parameter combination gave you the best results and what your best Nash-Sutcliffe was. Also they are the foundation for the plots we will produce in the next section.</p>
<h2>Visualization of the results</h2>
<p>If you have used the code for the whole model supplemented above you might have noticed that a .png appeared in the directoy of your model. If you didn't use the template you have to add one line at the end of you model code to activate the method plotsimulation: </p><pre class="fragment">#!python
    model.plotsimulation(threshold)
</pre><p>The treshold determines above which Nash-Sutcliffe model runs are used for the plot. The plot iself should look something like <a href="http://postimg.org/image/oh0zfrgox/">this</a>. The black line is the observed discharge, the red line is the simulated discharge of the best run and the yellow outlining represents the uncertainty.</p>
<p>With the Dotty Plot function (found in Downloads) and the *-parameter.csv you now can plot you own dotty plots. Just fill in the name of your parameter file in the function. Dotty plots are used for sensitivity analysis in order to identify which parameters are more identifiable than others and to establish more feasible ranges for the parameters. In a dotty plot the model effiency is plotted against the parameter value, showing which parameter value led to a good model run. Examples can be seen <a href="http://s32.postimg.org/skvz8gt1g/snow_melt_temp_dotty.jpg">here</a> and <a href="http://s32.postimg.org/hyxv7v1ms/tr_fulda_dotty.jpg">here</a>. The first plot shows an parameter that doesn't effect the model very much. No matter how high or low the snow melt temperatur is, the model stays pretty much the same. It is different for the second picture. Here you see a clear trend. The smaller the value of the parameter, the better the model run. This information can be used to give your parameter different boundaries. For example the parameter of the second picture should get a lower minimum as the trend shows in that direction.</p>
<h2>Validating the model</h2>
<p>After we now have at least a few runs of with good parameters we can start the validation of our model. For this we will need our results and make a few changes in our model.</p>
<p>To do here:</p>
<ul>
<li>explain how the validation works in CMF</li>
<li>explain how to use the plot functions to get a nice visualization of the validation</li>
</ul>
