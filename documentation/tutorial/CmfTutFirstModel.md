# Let it flow... the first cmf model

In this part, we are going to create a first model. To keep things
simple, the model will be extremely simple. In fact, it would be easier
to do this model in a spread sheet and keep cmf out of it. But of course
it is to introduce some of the elements of cmf.

## The model

The model is a simple linear storage equation to transport water from
one water storage (W,,1,,) to another water storage (W,,2,,).


@f[
q_{W_1,W_2}=\frac{V_1}{t_r}
@f]

where:

  - @f$q@f$ is the flux in @f$\frac {m^3}{day}@f$ from W,,1,, to
    W,,2,,
  - @f$V_1@f$ is the stored volume of water in W,,1,, in @f$m^3@f$
  - @f$t_r@f$ is the mean residence time of the water in W,,1,, in
    days.

## Implementation

The model (without the solver) is set up with the following lines of
code:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.py}

import cmf
p = cmf.project()
# Create W1 in project p 
W1 = p.NewStorage(name="W1",x=0,y=0,z=0)
# Create W2 in project p without any volume as an initial state
W2 = p.NewStorage(name="W2",x=10,y=0,z=0)
# Create a linear storage equation from W1 to W2 with a residence time tr of one day
q = cmf.kinematic_wave(source=W1,target=W2,residencetime=1.0)
# Set the initial state of w1 to 1mÂ³ of water.
W1.volume = 1.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

## The ordinary differential equation (ODE) system

### Formulation

With these lines the ODE (ordinary differential equation) system is
formulated:


@f[
\frac{dV_1}{dt} = -\frac{V_1}{t_r}
@f]


@f[
\frac{dV_2}{dt} = \frac{V_1}{t_r}
@f]

### Solving the system

Due to the simplicity of the model, it can be integrated analytically.


@f[
V_1(t) = V_1(t_0) e^{-t/t_r}
@f]


@f[
V_2(t) = V_1(t_0) (1-e^{-t/t_r})
@f]

But it is of course only a proxy model. For more interesting models with
stochastic boundary conditions, we need to use a numerical solution. For
numerical time integration any of the time integration schemes of cmf
will do for this model. If you are using more complex models with very
different velocities, error controlled and implicit solvers are
necessary.

### Implementing the numerical solution

To integrate our simple system in time, we create an integrator, for
example an explicit 4/5 step Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg integrator, the
[RKFIntegrator](@ref cmf::math::RKFIntegrator) (other integrators are
available, see later parts in the tutorial)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.py}

# Create an integrator for the ODE represented by project p, with an error tolerance of 1e-9
solver = cmf.RKFIntegrator(p,1e-9)
# Import Python's datetime module
import datetime
# Set the intitial time of the solver
solver.t = datetime.datetime(2012,1,1)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The code above is the setup part. Every cmf model consists of a setup
part, where the hydrological system is defined. For larger models,
Python's looping and conditional syntax and the possibility to read
nearly any data format can help to define the system from data.

## Running the system

Now we have all parts of our model available to run it. The solver can
be advanced for a certain time step using solver.integrate(dt), where dt
is a time step. After the integration the states and fluxes of the model
can be queried (see [Query fluxes and storages](@ref CmfTutFluxes)) and,
if needed, saved into a file. Or you can store the results in a Python
list or a cmf timeseries and use [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org) to
plot the results immediately after running the model. The content and
format of output is completely up to the user, some experience in
writing and reading files with Python is therefore a prerequisite to
design your own output.

In this example, we will write a csv file with the timestep, the state
of w1 and the state of w2.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.py}

# Create a csv file on disk for output, and write column headers
fout = open('firstmodel.csv','w')
fout.write('time,w1.volume m3,w2.volume m3\n')
# Run the model for 7 days, using a while loop
while solver.t < datetime.datetime(2012,1,7):
    # integrate the system for 1 h
    solver.integrate_until(solver.t + datetime.timedelta(hours=1))
    # write output (using the format operator %)
    fout.write('{t},{w1:0.4f},{w2:0.4f}\n'.format(t=solver.t,w1=W1.volume,w2=W2.volume))
fout.close()
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In principle, this is the base for all cmf models. In the next chapters,
we will introduce boundary conditions, more specialized water storages,
like soil layers and rivers, and have a look at solute transport.

## Alternative run time loop for plotting

An **alternative** way to the run time code above is using [list
comprehension](http://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html).
The result is then not written into a file, but stored in memory using a
list. This list can be plotted using the `pylab`-API of
[matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org). The setup code is as before.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.py}

# Iterate the solver hourly through the time range and return for each time step the volume in W1 and W2
result = [[W1.volume,W2.volume] for t in solver.run(datetime.datetime(2012,1,1),datetime.datetime(2012,1,7),datetime.timedelta(hours=1))]
import pylab as plt
plt.plot(result)
plt.xlabel('hours')
plt.ylabel('Volume in $m^3$')
plt.legend(('W1','W2'))
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

And this is the result:

Next step is to include [boundary conditions](@ref CmfTutBoundary).
