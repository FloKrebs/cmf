# Installation instructions

There are numerous ways to install cmf, depending on your operating
system, your Python environment and your choice of what you would like
to do with cmf. One important question is if you want to use geometric
objects in cmf, or not. No tutorial shows the use of these objects and
it is no problem to install geometric objects later.

The actual release of cmf @image html https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/cmf.svg
is available on the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/cmf).
