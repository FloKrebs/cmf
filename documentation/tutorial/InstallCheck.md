# Check the cmf installation

To check your cmf installation, start an [interactive python](@ref CmfRecommendedSoftwareEnvironment) console and type in the
following:

~~~~~~~~~~{.py}

import cmf
project = cmf.project()
cell = project.NewCell(0,0,0,1000)
~~~~~~~~~~


If you get an error message on the import statement, cmf is not
correctly installed or you have started the console in the source
directory of cmf. Refer to InstallCmf as a guidance.

A typical problem using the binary files in Windows, an error called
something like "Wrong Side-by-Side configuration". This happens by a
wrong Microsoft C++ Runtime environment. For Python 2, you need the 2008
version. Search the web for "vcredist.exe 2008" and add a x64 if you are
using a 64 bit Python.

If you have still problems, ask for guidance by e-mail. Please send the
exact steps you have been taking for installation together with a system
description (OS, Python interpreter, C++ compiler). If you don't get an
error message, you have created your first empty cmf-cell.
