@page contribOverview Contributing to cmf

## Thank you!

Thank you for thinking about helping to make cmf better. This page should help you how you
can help the best way.

## Submitting issues

If you just found a problem in cmf, let it be unclear documentation, performance issues
or the classic bug or anything else you would like to see fixed, submit an issue on GitHub.
We cannot guarantee a fast resolving of issues, the problem might be quite challenging a
no maintainer with the needed skills has enough time.

## Fixing issues

Check the issues at https://github.com/philippkraft/cmf/issues and select one to work on.
The issues are labelled by the maintainers with `documentation`, `python`, `swig` or `C++`.
Those labels indicate what skill set might be needed to fix that issue. Here you see a short 
list of the needed skills, and in the links you will find some rules and tips to contribute
to these parts.

### Documentation


To contribute to the documentation you need only writing skills. Simple fixes like typos
can be corrected directly in GitHub, if you have an account.

### Python tools

To contribute to the Python tools in cmf you need obviously some experience with Python -
but ideally you have been working with cmf already some time and you know the structure.
If you see any problem or shortcoming in cmf that needs new code, please submit an issue
as an proposal first and wait for comments, before you start coding.

### Changing the C++ core

If you want to contribute to the calculation core, some C++ knowledge is needed. The C++
part of CMf is obviously written by an environmental scientist and not by a professional
programmer.

@page contribIssues Submit an issue

If you find a bug, unclear parts of the docs, performance issues or if you find
a specific shortcoming of cmf please submit an issue on GitHub at 
https://github.com/philippkraft/cmf/issues.

When you write the issue please make clear if you are reporting a bug, a discomfort
or if you are suggesting an enhancement. Enhancements might be great ideas in general,
but if they are not fitting to the scope of cmf, they might still be rejected. However,
if you can publish your enhancement as a related but seperate project: great!
