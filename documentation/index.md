## What is cmf?

cmf is a __programming library__ to create __hydrological models__,
which are highly modular and connectible to other models developed using
a @subpage cmfIntroduction "multiple hypotheses background".
The library provides a programming interface consisting using
an object orientated approach. 

Although written in C++, its primary usage is to be compiled as an extension to other
programming languages, using [SWIG](http://www.swig.org). Until now only
[Python](http://www.python.org) is actively supported to use the
objects of cmf to set up a scope dependend, 
specialized model. cmf uses the @subpage finiteVolumeMethod "Finite Volume Method" 
to set up a wide range of models of water flow through your study area.
