# I'd like to contribute to cmf

1st: Thank you for that! CMF is open source and needs more work than hands are currently available.

## So what do you want to do?

### A) Report a problem

or

### B) Fix a known problem

Both options help us to make cmf better. If you have the feeling that you have both a report and the solution,
please still report first the problem and only after some discussion of the problem work on the solution.

## How to report a problem

You have started to use cmf with the help of the tutorials and you are starting to do something on your own,
and now cmf looks as it is broken. In that case, [start a new issue here on GitHub](https://github.com/philippkraft/cmf/issues) 
and describe your problem. 

### Documentation problems

Do you find some documentation to be difficult or misleading? Just submit an issue with the pointer to the problematic documentation

### I've got an error!

Put in some short code examples (<10 lines), to reproduce the problem. If you cannot provide a really short example
publish your problematic code somewhere (eg. as a [gist](https://gist.github.com/)) so someone else can run it. But 
the code should still be as short as possible and use as little extra files as possible. The better the problem is described the easier
a solution is found

## Fix a problem

If you want to fix an existing issue, fork cmf, create a branch named by the issue and create a pull request. Does that sound wierd to you?
It is easier than it sounds but you need to learn a bit of Git. Issues are labelled with either "documentation", "python", "swig" or "C++" 
depending on the knowledge needed to work on those issues. If you can't write C++, you should obviously not go for a C++ issue. 

Please do not start right away on a solution, but keep in discussion with the maintainers. Use a [WIP] (Work In Progress) tag on Pull requests
and create them early, even if you do not have really started.
