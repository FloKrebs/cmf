    The tutorials have been ported from one markup language to another and
    errors might have happened. If you find some code that is not working
    or if you find places that look weird, please raise an 
    [issue on GitHub](https://github.com/philippkraft/cmf/issues) - even if 
    __you__ know how to deal with that problem.
